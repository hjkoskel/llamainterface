You can see the local convenience store across the street, its windows shattered and doors hanging off their hinges",

In the foreground, there's a small, weathered bungalow on Elm Street, representing the character's home. Across the street, a local convenience store stands with its windows shattered, and doors barely hanging onto their hinges, giving a sense of abandonment and decay. The lighting is dim, with the sky clouded, adding to the haunting mood. The overall tone should evoke a sense of loneliness and survival."
