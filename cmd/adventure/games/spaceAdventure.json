    "Input": "You approach the entrance to the maze, your eyes adjusting to the dim light within. As you examine it more closely, you notice that the walls are made of a rough-hewn stone, with intricate carvings depicting scenes of battles and conquests. The air is stale and musty, and you can hear the distant sound of dripping water echoing off the walls. The entrance itself appears to be a simple doorway, but as you look closer, you notice that it's surrounded by a series of ancient runes etched into the stone. They seem to pulse with a faint blue light, as if they're imbued with some sort of magical energy. As you examine the entrance more closely, you notice that the walls are covered in cobwebs and dust, suggesting that this maze has been sealed off for centuries. You also see several symbols etched into the stone floor leading up to the doorway - a series of cryptic markings that seem to be some sort of puzzle or lock. To your left, you notice a small inscription carved into the wall: Beware the guardians of the labyrinth, For only those who prove worthy shall pass. What would you like to do?",

    "Result": "image of wooden door with surrounding stone walled wall with some cobwebs. runes glowing blue light on stone wall and on floor. photorealistic"
